<p>The story involves a California retiree’s struggle to deal with the aftermath of a young, autistic woman’s death and prominently features Hasbro’s popular board game Scrabble.

    Accompanying the book’s release, Grossman plans for a series of “performance readings.” One of these projects, a symphony played on an instrument of Grossman’s own design, has already taken place. The instrument, which Grossman refers to as the Car-iolon, is composed of thirteen cars (one of which he calls the harpsicar), which drive in tandem while playing music. The instrument plays a role in the book, and its first performance was held last Fall, with music specially composed for the event by Philip Glass. Other “readings” are planned to follow the book’s (tentative) release in 2008-2009.
    
    Did Grossman set out to write the world’s longest book? “Not really,” he said. “It just kept coming together

    Unlike most commercial songs or movies, popular novels vary greatly in length. The list of the best-selling books of all time includes titles ranging from 16,000 to 250,000 words. If there is an upper limit to how long novels can be, Marcel Proust reached it at the turn of the 20th century. His epic story À la recherché du temps perdu—or In Search of Lost Time—boasts nearly 1.3 million words, making it the world's longest book.

After receiving rejections from numerous editors, Proust used his own money to have the first volume released by the Grasset publishing house in 1913. The full novel was published in 13 volumes between 1913 and 1927.
    
    
    Though it's split up into multiple volumes, In Search of Lost Time is considered the longest novel ever published by Guinness World Records. This was determined by the book's impressive character count, which reaches 9,609,000. In some editions, the total page count is over 3000.
    
    There are many ways to measure history's superlative works of literature. In terms of physical size, the world's biggest book is a collection of stone tablets in Myanmar. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the world's smallest book—Teeny Ted from Turnip Town—can only be read through an electron microscope..”</p>
